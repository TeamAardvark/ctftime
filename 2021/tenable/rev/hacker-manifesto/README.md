Observations:

1. Each character seems to be encoded into 3 bytes
2. The first part seems to be "I am hacker,?nt???o?d."

I am[0308] h[0304]cker,[0804]ent[0708] [1204]y[0304]wo[0704]ld.
Mi[1304]e[0e04]is[240C]w[1310] [2004]h[0a04]t[0504]b[1304]g[1708]s[1208]i[0e08] [0704]c[0404]o[0104]l[2b0c] [4c04]'[4b08]s

is it sparsed?! are those numbers references to previous strings??!

I am a hacker,?ent?? ?y?wo?ld. 
I am a hacker, enter my world.
Mi
